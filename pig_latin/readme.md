Pig Latin is a based on a children's game in which English words are transformed into foreign sounding" words according to some simple rules. For words that begin with a vowel (letters `a', `e', `i', `o' and `u') just add \way" at the end. For example, "eat" --> "eatway"; "omelet" --> "omeletway"; "are" --> "areway".
For words like "pig" that begin with a consonant (non-vowels), all letters before the rest vowel are placed at the end of the word and then "ay" added at the end (the give "igpay" for "pig"). Other examples include: "banana" --> "ananabay"; "trash" --> "ashtray"; "happy" --> "appyhay"; "duck" --> "uckday"; "glove" --> "oveglay".
