Utilising this program will help in solving linear equations with n variables(n>=2).
Some of the features on this program:
1. it can accept any kind of variable (not just x,y,z... one can provide aplha, beta, gamma etc)
2. term can be written in anyway... so, one can enter this equations: 3x+4x+5x+6y=8z-2y+9
3. variables written before the number will be ignored and that number will be counted as a constant term.( 3x-4y-x5=6 --> in this case, there are two constant term - 5 and 6)
4. as now, decimal numbers are not supported, neither the fractional numbers.
